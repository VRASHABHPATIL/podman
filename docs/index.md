## 🤔 Why Podman?

Podman is a modern container engine that:
- 🚫 Requires **no daemon** (no docker.sock)
- 👤 Supports **rootless containers**
- 🐙 Uses **Docker-compatible commands**
- 🌐 Adds **Pods** like Kubernetes
- 🧬 Converts to **Kube YAML**
- 💪 Runs containers as **normal Linux processes**

In short — Podman prepares you for real production Kubernetes.
